;;;; -- Child processes --
;;;
;;; The shell needs more control over child setup than CCL's
;;; RUN-PROGRAM exposes.  In particular, every stage of a pipeline must
;;; enter one process group before any child is reaped, and the shell's
;;; ignored signals must be reset in the child without changing them in
;;; the multithreaded parent.  POSIX-SPAWN provides both guarantees.

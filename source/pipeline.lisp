;;;; -- Pipelines and sequences --
;;;
;;; Lisp helpers over shell commands: PIPE connects stages with Unix
;;; style pipes, SEQ runs stages one after another, ALL and ANY are the
;;; && and || equivalents, and CAPTURE returns a pipeline's output as a
;;; string. A stage is written (name argument...) where NAME resolves
;;; exactly like the first word of a command line and the arguments are
;;; evaluated Lisp expressions.
;;;
;;; Redirection is spelled as stages recognized by name inside PIPE and
;;; CAPTURE: (from "file") as the first stage feeds standard input,
;;; (to "file") or (append-to "file") as the last stage writes it, and
;;; anywhere in the pipeline (error-to "file"), (error-append-to
;;; "file") or (merge-error) direct the standard error of every stage
;;; to a file or into the ordinary output.
;;;
;;; Stages are connected with close-on-exec kernel pipes. Lisp builtin
;;; workers wrap their pipe descriptors as UTF-8 streams, while external
;;; programs receive the descriptors directly through POSIX spawn.
